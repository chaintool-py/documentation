## Documentation for chaintool

Chaintool is still very much a work-in-progress, and so to with its documentation.

So far, documentation efforts have been made in three areas, in order of most maintained first:


### Code dependency diagram

The dependency graph is only available in as an unformatted **graphviz** document located at `$REPO_ROOT/deps.dot`.

Last time the author remembered to render it, it looked like this:

It is defined in terms of three layers:

* The lower layer (grey) consists of libraries that were developed within the context of `chaintool`, but have a higher generic scope.
* The upper layer is all libraries that are considered part of the `chaintool` suite.
* The higher layer (green) are tools and daemons building on the `chaintool` suite libraries.


### Man pages

The `chainlib` module provides the script `chainlib-man.py` which provides an inheritance approach to generate man pages for CLI tools that build on the library.

An immediate example can be found in the `chainlib-eth` repository, where the directory `$REPO_ROOT/man` demonstrates how to add hooks for overriding both section contents and argument options for individual tools.

Invoking `make man` in the `chainlib-eth` and `eth-monitor` repositories will trigger a build of man pages for all the CLI tools provided.

What override behavior is currently available should be straightforward to glean from reading the `$CHAINLIB_REPO_ROOT/scripts/chainlib-man.py` script.


### Descriptive documentation

Some initial work for high-level documentation exists in the chainlib repository, specifically in `$REPO_ROOT/doc/texinfo`.

The documentation can be generated by running `make` in the `$REPO_ROOT` of **this** repository. The HTML version of the documentation will be output as a single file to `$REPO_ROOT/build/out/index.html`


### Docstrings

Not much to add here. Ye generic sphinx-doc invocation should do the trick.


## High-level implementations

To compensate somewhat for the lack of exhaustive documentation, actual implementations using the library may help light the way somewhat.

The known implementations that have some minimum level of maturity are listed below.


### High-level libraries

* **eth-erc20** - an implementation of the ERC20 token, which also includes an example token contract that lets authorized addresses arbitrarily mint tokens at any time.
* **eth-erc721** - an implementation of the ERC721 "NFT" token, which also includes an example token contract that creates achievment badges for developed contributions.


### High-level tools

* **eth-monitor** - which provides visualization and arbitrary code execution for mined transactions
* **chaind-eth** - a full-duplex transaction queueing tool for ethereum
